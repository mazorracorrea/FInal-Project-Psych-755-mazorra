    "**PART 5: Fine Tuning Model Gemma 3b**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tries to conduct an experiment into the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained language model. We take a base Gemma3 model (with 12b parameters) and further train it on our specific dataset of political tweets. The objective is to see if we can improve the model's performance and efficiency on our classification task by adapting it to the nuances of our data. However, we haven't achieved convincing results; the code remains to be advanced and modified in the future. The goal was to implement a low training process instead of a real fine-tuning process, which would require much more computational capacity. The low-rank tuning of models with libraries like LORA will introduce a new training process to the original model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structure:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports libraries: including datasets, ollama, and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data: Loads both the GPT-4 and Gemma-labeled datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample of 100 tweets is selected for this experiment. The data is formatted into a list of dictionaries, each containing a prompt (the tweet text) and a response (the corresponding JSON-formatted label).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-Shot Prompt: A  list of few_shot_examples is created with examples of tweet classifications that cover a range of polarization levels and styles. A build_few_shot_prompt function is defined to  construct the prompt. This function combines a detailed set of instructions, the curated few-shot examples, and the new tweet to be classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification with Few-Shot:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classify_with_ollama_gemma function sends the constructed few-shot prompt to the local Gemma model. The notebook iterates through the 100-tweet sample, using this advanced prompting technique to generate classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are saved to a new CSV file for comparison and analysis."
