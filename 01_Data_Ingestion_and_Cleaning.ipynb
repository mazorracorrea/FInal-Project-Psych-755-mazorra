    "This notebook aims to build the polarization classifier. For this task, we are using data downloaded through the software Synthesio, authorized by the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the research group on Social Media and Democracy from the School of Journalism and Mass Communication of the same university.\n",
    "The data was compiled by selecting all the interactions in the social network Twitter (X) on the day of the political presidential debates for the elections in the USA in the year 2024. The first debate was between the candidates Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump. The second debate was between the candidates Kamala Harris and Donald J. Trump.\n",
    "The key terms of the search were: a) interactions (mentions and retweets); b) boolean marker Biden AND Trump AND Kamala AND Trump; c) search specific for the dates of the political debates, one for the first debate and the other for the second debate.\n",
    "The data cap limit for collection was 50,000 tweets retrieved. The list of tweets was then downloaded by selecting chunks of time where the total interactions were less than 50,000 and downloading in a .csv file the total interactions publicly available.\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to produce a single dataset to work on this raw data and further anonymize the publicly available information."
