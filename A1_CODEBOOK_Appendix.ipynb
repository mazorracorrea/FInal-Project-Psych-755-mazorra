    "This notebook was not used in the current project in this final form. The purpose of this notebook was to achieve a better prompt for the GPT coder, or to generate a codebook for a human annotator coder, or to generate code to annotate the file directly through other libraries in Python, like re. While the use was not directed to the library, this code was useful to build the prompt for GPT, and it was added as a context for the task.\n",

    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "This codebook presents the criteria used to manually label tweets and messages along a 15-point political polarization scale, ranging from –7 (extreme left pole) to +7 (extreme right pole). Each entry is assigned two labels:\n",
    "\t•\tpolar_score: a numerical value from –7 to +7 or 'INV' for irrelevant content.\n",
    "\t•\tpole_label: a categorical tag: 'left', 'right', 'neutral', or 'inv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coding was based on a combination of ideological stance, affiliation cues, and sentiment direction toward political actors (Democratic vs. Republican), policies, or broader partisan coalitions. The code is part of a broader exercise in labelling political polarization across different countries leaded by the University \"Autónoma de Madrid\" in Spain, and followed for research groups across the world.\n",

    "–6\tleft\tStrongly negative toward Republicans, highly emotional tone, explicitly favoring far-left\t“MAGA fascists are ruining democracy — time for radical progressive reform.”\n",
    "–5\tleft\tStrongly negative toward Republicans only\t“Trump and the GOP are a threat to civil rights and the environment.”\n",
    "–4\tleft\tNegative toward Democrats (moderates) from the left\t“Biden is just a neoliberal — no different from Reagan economically.”\n",
    "–3\tleft\tModerate criticism of Democratic figures from the left\t“Why is Biden siding with corporations again? Not very progressive.”\n",

    "+4\tright\tNegative toward moderate Republicans from the right\t“Establishment Republicans are just Democrats in disguise.”\n",
    "+5\tright\tStrongly negative toward Democrats only\t“The radical left wants to destroy traditional America.”\n",
    "+6\tright\tHighly emotional, polarized attack on Democrats and progressives\t“Biden and his socialist cronies are turning this into Venezuela.”\n",

    "**Coding Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coders should evaluate messages based on:\n",
    "\t•\tTone: Is the message aggressive, satirical, or uplifting?\n",
    "\t•\tTarget: Who is being praised or criticized (left, right, both, neither)?\n",
    "\t•\tIntent: Is the goal to promote, criticize, unite, or mock?\n",
    "\t•\tLexicon: Does it use partisan labels (e.g., MAGA, woke, neoliberal)?\n",
    "\t•\tReferences: Mentions of parties, figures (e.g., Trump, Biden), or ideological frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes**\n",
    "\t•\tMessages may express ideological criticism across axes (e.g., anti-system, anti-elite, libertarian). Use –7 or +7 only when this critique targets both major parties from a distinct pole.\n",
    "\t•\tIf unclear whether a message supports or attacks either side, assign 0 or 'INV' depending on clarity and relevance.\n",
    "\t•\tHumor, irony, or sarcasm must be interpreted in context. When ambiguous, err on the side of caution (e.g., 0 or INV).\n"
